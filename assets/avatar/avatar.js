// avatar.js — Mind as a whole body. Replaces AssistantFace, and keeps its
// public shape (`speak`, `setMood`, `resize`, `dispose`) so the window that
// hosts her does not have to care which one it got.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY DOES is arbitrate. Five things want to write her
// bones and her face every frame — the animation mixer, the procedural idle,
// the lip sync, the look-at, and the spring bones — and the only reason it
// works is that they run in a fixed order with explicit weights. Get the order
// wrong and one silently erases another with no error to show for it:
//
//   1. mixer      the clip, if any, writes every bone it owns
//   2. idle       breathing / fidget / nods, SLERPED over the top by a weight
//                 that drops to a whisper while a clip is playing
//   3. expressions viseme weights, then mood, then blink
//   4. vrm.update propagates the normalized rig to the real one, runs look-at
//                 and the spring bones LAST, so hair reacts to the final pose
//
// WHY THE CAMERA CHANGES SHOT. A fixed wide shot wastes the expression work —
// while she talks her face is forty pixels tall. A fixed close shot throws away
// the body. So the shot follows the state: bust while speaking, full while
// idle. See framing.js for why the distances are measured rather than typed.

 * zero. The face just never smiled, with nothing to show why.
